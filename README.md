## 1. AloAlo

The main purpose of this PSR is to provide a complete and formal definition of
the PHPDoc standard. This PSR deviates from its predecessor, the de-facto PHPDoc
Standard associated with [phpDocumentor 1.x][PHPDOC.ORG], to provide
support for newer features in the PHP language and to address some of the
shortcomings of its predecessor.

This document SHALL NOT:

* Describe a standard for implementing annotations via PHPDoc. Although it does
  offer versatility which makes it possible to create a subsequent PSR based on
  current practices. See [chapter 5.3](#53-tags) for more information on this
  topic.
* Describe best practices or recommendations for Coding Standards on the
  application of the PHPDoc standard. This document is limited to a formal
  specification of syntax and intention.
